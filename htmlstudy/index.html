        <h1> This is level 1 header</h1>
        <h2>This is level 2 header</h2>
        <h3>This is level 3 header</h3>
        <h4>This is level 4 header</h4>

        <p> this is <b>first</b> <u>para</u></p>
        <hr>

        <p>His mouth started to speak, <b><u>but his brain</u></b> decided it hadn't
            got anything to say yet and shut it again.</p>
        <p>Once more gathering up the jaw, <b>his brain </b><u>lost control
             of his left hand</u> which then wandered around in an aimless fashion. &dagger; or &clubs; Thank you</p>

        <p>
             <pre>
            This is     a     sentence with
                  some bizarre formatting.
            </pre>
        </p>
