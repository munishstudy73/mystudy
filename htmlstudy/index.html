        <p>His mouth started to speak, <b><u>but his brain</u></b> decided it hadn't
            got anything to say yet and shut it again.</p>
        <p>Once more gathering up the jaw, <b>his brain </b><u>lost control
             of his left hand</u> which then wandered around in an aimless fashion. &dagger; or &clubs; Thank you</p>

        <p>
             <pre>
            This is     a     sentence with
                  some bizarre formatting.
